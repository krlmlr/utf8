*utf8* is an R package for manipulating and printing UTF-8 text that fixes
[multiple][windows-enc2utf8] [bugs][emoji-print] in R's UTF-8 handling.


Installation
------------

### Stable version

*utf8* is [available on CRAN][cran]. To install the latest released version,
run the following command in R:

```r
install.packages("utf8")
```

### Development version

To install the latest development version, run the following:

```r
devtools::install_github("patperry/r-utf8")
```


Usage
-----

```{r}
library(utf8)
```

### Validate character data and convert to UTF-8

Use `as_utf8()` to validate input text and convert to UTF-8 encoding. The
function alerts you if the input text has the wrong declared encoding:

```{r, error = TRUE}
# second entry is encoded in latin-1, but declared as UTF-8
x <- c("fa\u00E7ile", "fa\xE7ile", "fa\xC3\xA7ile")
Encoding(x) <- c("UTF-8", "UTF-8", "bytes")
as_utf8(x) # fails

# mark the correct encoding
Encoding(x[2]) <- "latin1"
as_utf8(x) # succeeds
```

### Normalize data

Use `utf8_normalize()` to convert to Unicode composed normal form (NFC).
Optionally apply compatibility maps for NFKC normal form or case-fold.

```{r}
# three ways to encode an angstrom character
(angstrom <- c("\u00c5", "\u0041\u030a", "\u212b"))
utf8_normalize(angstrom) == "\u00c5"

# perform full Unicode case-folding
utf8_normalize("Größe", map_case = TRUE)

# apply compatibility maps to NFKC normal form
# (example from https://twitter.com/aprilarcus/status/367557195186970624)
utf8_normalize("𝖸𝗈 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐨𝐝𝐞 𝗅 𝗁𝖾𝗋𝖽 𝕌 𝗅𝗂𝗄𝖾 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑠 𝗌𝗈 𝗐𝖾 𝗉𝗎𝗍 𝗌𝗈𝗆𝖾 𝚌𝚘𝚍𝚎𝚙𝚘𝚒𝚗𝚝𝚜 𝗂𝗇 𝗒𝗈𝗎𝗋 𝔖𝔲𝔭𝔭𝔩𝔢𝔪𝔢𝔫𝔱𝔞𝔯𝔶 𝔚𝔲𝔩𝔱𝔦𝔩𝔦𝔫𝔤𝔳𝔞𝔩 𝔓𝔩𝔞𝔫𝔢 𝗌𝗈 𝗒𝗈𝗎 𝖼𝖺𝗇 𝓮𝓷𝓬𝓸𝓭𝓮 𝕗𝕠𝕟𝕥𝕤 𝗂𝗇 𝗒𝗈𝗎𝗋 𝒇𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒔.",
               map_compat = TRUE)
```

### Print emoji

On some platforms (including MacOS), the R implementation of `print()` uses an
outdated version of the Unicode standard to determine which characters are
printable. Use `utf8_print()` for an updated print function:

```{r}
print(intToUtf8(0x1F600 + 0:79)) # with default R print function

utf8_print(intToUtf8(0x1F600 + 0:79)) # with utf8_print, truncates line

utf8_print(intToUtf8(0x1F600 + 0:79), chars = 1000) # higher character limit
```


Citation
--------

Cite *utf8* with the following BibTeX entry:

```{r echo = FALSE, comment = NA}
print(suppressWarnings(citation("utf8")), "Bibtex")
```
